# Gemini Pro Web Application

## Overview

This repository contains two Streamlit web applications for interacting with Google Gemini AI: `app.py` for Question/Answer (Q/A) and `Gemini-vision.py` for image recognition and description creation. The applications leverage the Google Gemini Pro and Gemini Pro Vision models.

## Prerequisites

Before running the applications, make sure to set up the necessary environment variables by creating a `.env` file and populating it with your Google API key.

```bash
# .env file
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key


Install the required dependencies by running:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Q/A Application (app.py)
This application allows users to ask questions using the Gemini Pro model and receive responses.

bash

streamlit run app.py
Enter your question in the text input.
Click the "Submit" button to get Gemini's response.
Image Recognition and Description Application (Gemini-vision.py)
This application utilizes the Gemini Pro Vision model for image recognition and description creation.

bash

streamlit run Gemini-vision.py
Enter text in the provided text input.
Upload an image using the file uploader.
Click the "How do you feel about this image?" button to get Gemini's response.

Configuration
Ensure that the environment variable GOOGLE_API_KEY is set to your Google API key in the .env file.

Usage
Follow these steps to run the Gemini Pro Web Application:

Configure your Google API key in the .env file.
Install the required dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.
Run the Q/A application using streamlit run app.py.
Run the Image Recognition and Description application using streamlit run Gemini-vision.py.
